# YogaNews

A simple android app that loads news about yoga from the Guardian API. This is my practice for the networking course in Udacity Basic Android Nanodegree. The practice app uses the Guardian news API to apply the concept of AsyncTask loaders and JSON parsing.I've also used Glide library for loading article images.
